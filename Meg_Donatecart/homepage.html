          <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
          <blockquote>
            "There Could be no definition of a successful life that does not
            include service to others."
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "It's not how much we give but how much love we put into giving"
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "We Make A Living By What We Get. We Make A Life By What We Give"

          <h2>Our Thinking</h2>
          <p>
            We Always See That The Citizens throw away their clothes belongings
            if they get the new ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            So We Came up with the idea that if a user who wants donate their
            old belongings or the generous donors who want to donate new ones
            will be able to donate.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Donations Will be useful for the poor people who need clothes
            or the poor students who are in need of gadgets for education
          </p>

            We Had Tied Up With Various Public Ngos To Benefit the users at a
            faster rate and needful users can register in our website
